# Double Auctions: An Introduction

Community Systems Working Group

# What is a Double Auction?

A double auction is a market mechanism where buyers and sellers declare orders to buy or sell an asset.

- **Example**: A street vendor and a tourist haggling over the price of a souvenir.

---

# Why double auctions matter

Double auctions perform **price discovery** -- the process of deciding a reasonable value for an asset.

Electronic double auctions are a modern global forum. They communicate the need and availability of goods and services worldwide. They can do this across national borders, languages, and cultures, often reallocating resources within milliseconds of an event.

---

# Double Auctions Govern Governments

A government's ability to function is ultimately limited by what the bond market (a double auction) is willing to lend to the government's treasury.

Bond traders lend money to a government by buying government bonds. For example:
- The US Treasury might wish to sell a bond that is worth $1000 in 10 years.  
- The US Treasury might try to sell this bond for $900 today.
- Whether the sale is successful depends on whether anyone is willing to buy the bond for $900 and accept the risk that the government might not repay the bond 10 years from now.

_"You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of &#^%@ bond traders?" -- Bill Clinton_

- Whether between individuals or nations, double auctions are a key mechanism for decentralized governance.

---

# Key Features of Double Auctions

- **Buyers** submit orders to buy an asset.
- **Sellers** submit orders to sell an asset.
- A **Matching** process pairs buy and sell orders to **execute** trades.

---

# Limit Orders 

Double auctions are based on **limit orders**.

A limit order is an order to buy or sell an asset at a specified price or better.

- **Buy Limit Order**: Sets the maximum price at which you're willing to buy.
  - Also known as a "bid" or "buy"
  - We'll use "bid" in this presentation.
- **Sell Limit Order**: Sets the minimum price at which you're willing to sell.
  - Also known as an "ask," "offer," or "sell"
  - We'll use "ask" in this presentation.

---

# Limit Order examples

- **Bid Order**:
  - A proposal to buy a certain amount of an asset at a specified price.
  - Example: Buy 100 units at $5 each.
- **Ask Order**:
  - A proposal to sell a certain amount of an asset at a specified price.
  - Example: Sell 100 units at $6 each.

---

# Example of a Bid Order 

**I promise to pay $5 each for 100 units of XYZ.**
- This means you are committing to spending a total of $500 to buy 100 units of XYZ if your bid is accepted by someone else.

In traders' shorthand, this might be written as:

```
BID 100 XYZ @5.00 USD
```

---

# Example of an Ask Order

**I promise to sell 50 units of XYZ at $10 each.**
- This means you are offering to sell a total of 50 units of XYZ for $10 each, expecting a total return of $500 if your ask is accepted.

In shorthand:

```
ASK 50 XYZ @10.00 USD
```

---

# Order Book

Buyers and sellers record each other's bids and asks in an **order book**. This gives them a sense of the market's supply and demand.

Example of a simplified order book:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 100          |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

# Discussion Questions: Understanding the Order Book

Here is a detailed look at an order book. Consider the following questions:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 100          |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

## Discussion Questions:
1. What price will someone pay if they submit a market bid order?
2. What price will someone sell at if they submit a market ask order?

---

# Bid-Ask Spread

The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask).

Example: In this order book, the XYZ bid-ask spread is $1.50 (6.50 - 5.00).

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 100          |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

---

# Matching Engine

In an electronic trading system, the **matching engine** is a component that matches buy and sell orders from the order book.  

---

# Matching Engine in Action: Step 1

Here is our starting order book -- the bid-ask spread is $4.50 (9.00 - 4.50), so no trades are happening:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

A buyer submits a bid for 100 units of XYZ at $5 each. The bid-ask spread is now $4 (9.00 - 5.00), still no trade:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

---

# Matching Engine in Action: Step 2

A seller submits an ask for 50 units of XYZ at $6.50 each. The bid-ask spread is now $1.50, still no trade:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 50           |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

---

# Matching Engine in Action: Step 3

Another seller submits an ask for 100 units of XYZ at $5 each. The matching engine notices that the bid-ask spread is now $0:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 50           |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          |         | 5.00    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

---

# Matching Engine in Action: Step 4

The matching engine now executes a trade between the buyer and the seller at $5 each for 50 units of XYZ, removing those 50 units from the order book. The remaining `ASK 50 @5.00` remain in the book, because no more bid orders match:

  | Quantity XYZ | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 50           |         | 6.50    |
  | 50           |         | 5.00    |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |

# How Double Auctions Are Used in Currency Exchange Trades

There is no difference between trading currencies and trading other assets in a double auction. When trading two currencies, we choose one currency to be our "asset" and the other currency to be what we're using for "money".  

For example, if we want to buy 100 EUR by spending USD, and we think that the Euro is worth 1.10 USD, we submit a bid to buy 100 EUR at 1.10 USD each:

```
BID 100 EUR @1.10 USD
```

---

# Currency Exchange Order Book

This is what an order book might look like for a currency exchange. Here traders are buying and selling euros (EUR) using US dollars (USD):

  | Quantity EUR | Bid USD | Ask USD |
  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 1000         |         | 1.30    |
  | 2000         |         | 1.25    |
  | 1500         |         | 1.20    |
  | 2000         | 1.10    |         |
  | 3000         | 1.05    |         |
  | 4000         | 1.00    |         |

## Discussion:  Which Currency is worth more?

In the above order book, which currency has higher value per unit, the USD or the EUR?

# Market Orders

A market order is an order to buy or sell an asset immediately at the best available current price.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Immediate Execution: No waiting for a matching order at a specific price.
  - Guaranteed Order Fulfillment: As long as there are willing buyers/sellers in the market.
  - No Price Guarantee: You get the next available price, which might fluctuate.

- **Example**:
  - If a buyer submits a market order to buy 100 units of XYZ, the order will be matched with any available sell orders (asks) on the order book. If the lowest ask price is $5.50, the market order will execute at that price.

```
BID 100 XYZ @MARKET
```

---

# Retail Traders and Market Orders

Retail traders (consumers) often use market orders, not knowing that they might be paying a higher price than using limit orders because:

- A buy order will get filled at the **ask** price, which is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.
- A sell order will get filled at the **bid** price, which is the highest price a buyer is willing to pay.

**Example**:
- If the order book has a bid price of $5.00 and an ask price of $5.50:
  - Using a market order to buy will execute at $5.50.
  - Using a market order to sell will execute at $5.00.

This difference can lead to higher costs or lower profits for retail traders who might not be aware of these nuances.

---

# Market Makers: Income from Bid-Ask Spread

Market makers are participants who place limit orders, setting the inside bid and ask prices.

- **Income from Bid-Ask Spread**:
  - Market makers buy at the bid price and sell at the ask price.
  - The difference (spread) is their profit.
  
  Example: 
  - Buy 100 units at $5 each (total $500).
  - Sell 100 units at $6 each (total $600).
  - Profit: $100 ($600 - $500).

- In most markets, **anyone can be a Market Maker**:
  - As long as the spread is wide enough to cover costs and provide a profit.
  - Costs include transaction fees, risk of price movement, and holding costs.

# How Double Auctions Work in Peer-to-Peer Markets

- **Decentralized Markets**:
  - Peer-to-peer platforms where users can trade directly without intermediaries.
  - Double auctions help match buyers and sellers in these decentralized environments.
- **Advantages**:
  - Increased Market Efficiency: Direct matching leads to efficient price discovery.
  - Reduced Transaction Costs: Elimination of intermediaries reduces costs for participants.
  - Enhanced Privacy and Security: Use of cryptographic protocols ensures privacy and security.
  
---

# Implementing Double Auctions in a Decentralized System

- **Decentralized Matching Engine**:
  - Peer-to-peer network nodes work together to match buy and sell orders.
  - Ensures robustness and removes single points of failure.
- **Advantages**:
  - Resilience
  - Transparency
  - Efficiency in resource distribution
  - Enhanced trust among participants

---

# Tracking Multiple Local Microcurrencies and Resource Allocation

- **Microcurrencies**:
  - Digital tokens used within localized, decentralized systems.
  - Help quantify and manage local resources and services.
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Double auctions can optimize the distribution of resources by matching supply and demand efficiently.
  - Example: Local communities trading solar energy credits.
