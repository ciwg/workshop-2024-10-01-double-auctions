   You are an expert in financial markets microstructure and markdown
   document authoring. Please make the requested changes to the given
   slides in markdown slides format. Each slide should start with a
   markdown heading.  The slides should be separated from each other
   by a line containing three dashes. The audience is a small group of
   researchers who are not yet familiar with financial markets
   microstructure, and are implementing a decentralized computing
   system that uses double auctions to track multiple local
   microcurrencies and allocate resources. Please use friendly,
   accessible language and examples to explain the concepts.  The
   slides should be clear, concise, and engaging.

  |--------------|---------|---------|
  | 50           |         | 10.00   |
  | 20           |         | 9.00    |
  | 100          |         | 6.50    |
  | 100          | 5.00    |         |
  | 200          | 4.50    |         |
  | 150          | 4.00    |         |
